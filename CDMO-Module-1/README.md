# **Modelling and solving the VLSI problem**

This repository contains the project for combinatorial and Decision Making and Optimization course exam of the [Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence, University of Bologna](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/artificial-intelligence).

**Description of the Problem**
VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) refers to the trend of integrating circuits into silicon chips. A typical example is the smartphone. The modern trend of shrinking transistor sizes, allowing engineers to fit more and more transistors into the same area of silicon, has pushed the integration of more and more functions of cellphone circuitry into a single silicon die (i.e.plate). This enabled the modern cellphone to mature into a powerful tool that shrank from the size of a large brick-sized unit to a device small enough to comfortably carry in a pocket or purse, with a video camera, touchscreen, and other advanced features.As the combinatorial decision and optimization expert, you are assigned to design the VLSI of the circuits defining your electrical device: given a fixed-width plate and a list of rectangular circuits, decide how to place them on the plate so that the length of the final device is minimized (improving its portability). In order for the device to work properly, each circuit must be placed in a fixed orientation with respect to the others, therefore it cannot be rotated.
